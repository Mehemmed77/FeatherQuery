ðŸª¶ FeatherQuery
Data fetching, light as a feather.
A lightweight React library for fetching, caching, and mutating API data with minimal boilerplate.

âœ¨ Why FeatherQuery?

Modern data-fetching libraries like TanStack Query or RTK Query are powerful, but they often feel heavy and require tons of setup. FeatherQuery is designed to be:

ðŸª¶ Lightweight â€“ no clutter, no extra configs

âš¡ Fast & efficient â€“ built with caching, refetching, and mutations in mind

ðŸŽ¯ Simple API â€“ just drop in a hook and go

ðŸ”§ Extensible â€“ start simple, scale when needed

ðŸš€ Features

useFetch â€“ Fetch and cache API data with built-in loading & error states

useMutation â€“ Perform POST/PUT/DELETE requests with cache invalidation

Auto refetch (intervals & on demand)

Optional cache policies (stale time, cache time)

TypeScript-first design

Tiny bundle size
